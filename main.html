<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
      Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of its input. It measures the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of time. Algorithms with lower time complexity are more efficient.
    </p>

  <p>
  <bold>Space Complexity</bold> is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the length of its input. It is often denoted as O(n), where 'n' represents the size of the input. Algorithms with lower space complexity use less memory and are generally preferred.
