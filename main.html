	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>
		Time complexity is  a type of computational complexity that describes the time required to execute an algorithm. The time complexity of an algorithm is the amount of time and efficient it takes for each statement to complete.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Space Complexity</b> is refers to the total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program, including the space of input values for execution. Calculate the space occupied by variables in an program to determine space complexity O(n).
